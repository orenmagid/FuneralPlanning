    <h3 class="display-4">Disposition</h3>
    <div class="lead">
      <p>"Disposition" is the term for what will be done with one's body after passing&mdash;either cremation or burial.</p>
      <p>With burial, one's is placed in a grave, most likely at a cemetery. Gravesites offer a place for family and friends to visit. Accompanying services are usually held at the gravesite. You also have the option of a green burial, an environmentally conscious way of handling burial practices. Visit the <a href="https://greenburialcouncil.org/home/what-is-green-burial/">Green Burial Council</a> for additional information.</p>
      <p>Cremation reduces your remains to ash that can either be scattered, housed at a cemetery, or kept at home.</p>
