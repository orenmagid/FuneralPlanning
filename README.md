# A Funeral Planning App

This is the repository for a project <a href="https://github.com/AugustGiles">August Giles</a> and I worked on for the Ruby on Rails module of the Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering Bootcamp. 

It's an app to help people think about how you they want to be remembered, and to help them leave guidance for those who will be tasked with making arrangements in the event of their passing. The app walks people through many of the relevant choices and options to consider when planning ahead. The app also gives people the opportunity to record other wishes or concerns. Once one has throught through and recorded one's wishes, one can nominate reprentatives, and send one's wishes to these representatives. (We had hoped to implement functionality allowing users to email their wishes to their representtives, but as of now, one can export or print a PDF.)
