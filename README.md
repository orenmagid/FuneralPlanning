# A Funeral Planning App

This is the repository for a project <a href="https://github.com/AugustGiles">August Giles</a> and I worked on in the Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering Bootcamp. 

It's an app to help people think about how you they want to be remembered, and to help them leave guidance for those who will be tasked with making arrangements in the event of their passing. The app walks people through many of the relevant choices and options to consider when planning ahead. The app also gives people the opportunity to record other wishes or concerns. Once one has throught through and recorded one's wishes, one can nominate reprentatives, and send one's wishes to these representatives. (We had hoped to implement functionality allowing users to email their wishes to their representtives, but as of now, one can export or print a PDF.)



## Demo

You can check it out at https://funeral-planning-app.herokuapp.com/. Because Heroku's <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours">free dyno hours</a> <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#dyno-sleeping">go to sleep</a> if the app hasn't been used in thirty minutes, the app may be unresponsive for about 30 secs when you first attempt to use it. Unfortunately, this applies to the frontend and the backend. So, it may be about thirty seconds before the webpage loads, and then another delay before the database is responsive.
