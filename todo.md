Oren:
* Stat stuff - I just barely started.

August:
* Refactoring?
* Stat stuff
    Percentage breakdown by service_type (independent of religion and by religion) - August
    Maybe breakdown of users by religion - August

Overall List:
* Email summary to contacts? (compose message)
* static_pages/home
* I think we should perhaps have text saying that they can specify their wishes
    about their ashes, if they are cremated, in the "expand" field. At least,
    that's something I think some people would expect--a place to note that.

Wednesday:
* Add and edit language throughout
* Add CSS to improve user e-xperience
