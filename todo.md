Oren:
<!-- * Links back to Menu -->
* Stat stuff - I just barely started.
<!-- * Add new expand fields to funeral show and overall show pages - it's ugly, but I did it. Also had to make changes to the strong params. -->

August:
* Refactoring?
* Stat stuff


Overall List:
* Print Overall Summary to PDF?
* Email summary to contacts? (compose message)
* Validations
* static_pages/home
* Funeral Home Select - Either make sure we aren't creating dups with text_field entry or create a smart text field autofills options
* Should we add a "I'm not sure" options of the funeral home?
* Actually, yes. I just tried to submit it without selecting any funeral home, and it was rejected b/c "funeral home must exist." The page reloaded, but all the information I entered was gone.
* I think we should perhaps have text saying that they can specify their wishes about their ashes, if they are cremated, in the "expand" field. At least, that's something I think some people would expect--a place to note that.
* Change all occurrences in DB of "agent" to "contact"

Wednesday Morning:
* Add and edit language throughout
* Add CSS to improve user e-xperience
